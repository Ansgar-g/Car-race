# Car-race
This is my first project bigger than 50 lines (almost 100 atm). In this project, 3 cars are compared by giving its name, speed gain per sec and max speed. after that, a function adds speed per sec to the current speed of the car in a 1 sec Interval. This is done for all 3 cars. Now, the time every car needs to get to its max. speed is compared. 

finished: 
1. Replacing the parameters used to determine the speed of each car. Instead of "speed gained per second", I want to use "Meters gained per sec". With this, I can find out how much km/h the car drives and use that to determine how much Time every car needs to get to a certain point (in meters).

2. Not limiting the max. racing participants to 3. Instead, doing a game loop which is left when a set variable is set to true; by the user. While this Variable is set to false; the game should ask for brand, speed and max. speed again and again. 

next steps will be:
